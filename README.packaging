Bless - Gtk# Hex Editor Packaging Notes
=======================================

This document is aimed at people trying to package Bless
for a specific distribution.

Bless can easily be packaged using the following method:

configure --prefix=/usr
make
make prefix=/tmp-pkg-path install

The contents of the /tmp-pkg-path can then be compressed and
distributed as a package. 

The only problem with this procedure is that Bless by default tries 
to register its documentation with Scrollkeeper (if it is found) 
during make install and unregister it during make uninstall. However
this is not wanted on the packager`s system but on the user's system. 

To overcome this, Bless should be configured without scrollkeeper support
by the packager:

configure --without-scrollkeeper

and the post-install and post-uninstall scripts of the packaging system should
take care of registering and unregistering the documentation.

*Note* that the path of the help file in the .omf file is set at make time using
the configured prefix. This is done using the 'scrollkeeper-preinstall' command
which should therefore be present in the packager's system. In case it is
not present, the post-install script should also set that path.

A sample rpm bless.spec file is supplied with the bless source package.
