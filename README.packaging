Bless - Gtk# Hex Editor Packaging Notes
=======================================

This document is aimed at people trying to package Bless
for a specific distribution.

Bless can easily be packaged using the following method:

meson setup build -Dprefix=/usr
ninja -C build
DESTDIR=/tmp-pkg-path ninja -C build install

The contents of the /tmp-pkg-path can then be compressed and
distributed as a package.
